# BankAPITest
This is a school/tournament project!
We are competing in the NÐ•TIT(National Autumn Tournament in Information Technologies) tournament, where you have to choose from a from a few project ideas and make them real or come up with your own project idea!

# About
This is a desktop based application where if you are 18 years old or older, you can register an account in which you can create virtual debit cards of type Visa or MasterCard. Also you can also pay your bills by creating an invoice, which can be personal or company invoice. You can see your transactions in the transactions tab. And finally you can transfer money to another account.

NOTE!
YOU CANNOT PAY ANYTHING THRU THE APPLICATION AS IT'S NOT A REAL BANK! THIS IS ONLY VIRTUAL/DIGITAL MONEY AND DEBIT CARDS!
